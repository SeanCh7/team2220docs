# Photoelectric Sensor

## Usage

The photoelectric sensor is used to sense the presence of an object within a certain distance. It cannot detect the distance. Sensitivity/Range is set using the potentiometer on the back. The photoelectric sensor interacts with the [RoboRIO ](../roborio/)using the digital input/output ports.
